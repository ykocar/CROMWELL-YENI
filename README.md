### **CROMWELL Listing Products Test Project**

This project contains a test automation framework.

I have written my test cases by using JavaScript as a programming language and Cypress as a testing tool.

I have added my test cases under "integration" package. 

I have used Page Object Design and added my locators and methods under "Support" package.

I have added my Base Url address within "cypress.json" file.

The required repositories are in "package.json" file.

In order to run Fourth (4.) test case, we need chai-sorted dependency. Before running this test case please: 

- RUN "npm i chai-sorted" in Terminal
- In support/index.js add:

const chaiSorted = require('chai-sorted');
chai.use(chaiSorted); 

Thanks.
